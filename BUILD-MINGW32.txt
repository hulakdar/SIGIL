BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING MINGW32 IN WINDOWS
---------------------------------------------------

If you haven't already, you should download the latest MinGW32 compiler from:

	https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/

This guide assumes that you'll be using this compiler. If this is not the case, some of the instructions and directories in this guide will need to be changed to reflect your approach. Please also note that the MingW32 compiler provided by a CodeBlocks IDE installation is not currently up to date and may not work properly. Therefore, you should use the one referenced above.

SIGIL uses CMake, which is a cross-platform build tool. You will need to download and run the CMake "Windows Installer" (.msi). When the installer asks, make sure you add CMake to your PATH variable. You can download the installer from:

	https://cmake.org/download/

Next, download SIGIL. If you have git, you can use a command prompt:

	git clone https://gitlab.com/geoff-nagy/sigil.git

Otherwise, you can download the source code as a .zip file from:

	https://gitlab.com/geoff-nagy/sigil

Navigate to SIGIL's root directory, and enter the "deps" folder. This is where CMake-based dependencies of SIGIL are located. We will use Git to acquire GLFW and Freetype2. (You can ignore the "pigu" folder---it is used for Raspberry Pi builds.)

Type the following:

    git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
    git clone git://git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2.git

SIGIL depends on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library. Headers and pre-compiled libs are included with SIGIL in the /glew folder. Copy and paste the following files into the appropriate locations as below:

	sigil/glew/lib/mingw32/libglew32.dll.a    ---> C:/MinGW/lib/libglew32.dll.a
	sigil/glew/include/GL/*.h                 ---> C:/MinGW/include/GL/*.h

We need OpenAL for audio. Download the "OpenAL 1.1 Core SDK (zip)" file from

	https://www.openal.org/downloads/

and extract and run the installer. When prompted, you should also run the OpenAL redistributable, which will place the OpenAL DLLs into your system folder. After all of this, copy the OpenAL header files into the proper location:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenAL 1.1 SDK\include\*.h    ---> C:\MinGW\include\*.h

Next, we can start building SIGIL. Enter the directory "sigil" and create a folder called "build-mingw32".

Open CMake-GUI. For "Where is the source code", browse to the root directory "sigil". For "Where to build the binaries", browse to the directory "build-mingw32" that you created in the previous step.

Click "Configure". When prompted, select the "MinGW Makefiles" generator from the drop-down list. Select "Use default native compilers", and click "Finish".

NOTE: CMake may find the incorrect MinGW32 compiler on your system if you have more than one installed. For example, the CodeBlocks IDE comes with its own, but unfortunately it is out of date and will likely generate errors. Therefore, please ensure that you are using the correct MinGW32 compiler by checking these variables:

CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:            C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_AR          C:/MinGW/bin/gcc-ar.exe
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_RANLIB:     C:/MinGW/bin/gcc-ranlib.exe

CMAKE_C_COMPILER:              C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe
CMAKE_C_COMPILER_AR:           C:/MinGW/bin/gcc-ar.exe
CMAKE_C_COMPILER_RANLIB:       C:/MinGW/bin/gcc-ranlib.exe

Alternatively, you can "Specify native compilers" to use manually during the CMake "Configure" step instead of selecting "Use default native compilers".

Depending on your system configuration, CMake may have trouble finding the required dependencies. For your reference, these are the values that I use to compile SIGIL.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:               Release
GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR:               C:/MinGW/include
GLEW_LIBRARY_DEBUG:             C:/MinGW/lib/libglew32.dll.a
GLEW_LIBRARY_RELEASE:           C:/MinGW/lib/libglew32.dll.a
OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR:             C:/MinGW/include/AL
OPENAL_LIBRARY:                 C:/Windows/System32/OpenAL32.dll

If errors occur, not all of the above variables may be immediately present. You'll need to fix any existing errors and click "Configure" again for the remaining variables to appear. Repeat this process until the configuration completes without errors---you should only have to do this once or twice if you've set everything up correctly. (It's also possible that CMake will assign the correct values to all of these variables on the first try; it depends on your system configuration.)

If no errors occurred during configuration (a message box will appear if there are errors), you can click "Generate". This will generate a Makefile that we will use to compile SIGIL.

Make sure the MinGW32 compiler is in your PATH variable. The path to your MinGW32 compiler is probably

	C:/MinGW/bin

but it may vary depending on where you've installed MinGW32.

Open a terminal in the "build-mingw32" directory. Type

	mingw32-make

This will create the files

	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll.a

It's probably now a good idea to put all of the necessary SIGIL files in a common location for you to copy into your SIGIL projects later on. This is the same process that I use when building and distributing SIGIL.

	C:/Windows/System32/OpenAL32.dll    ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/OpenAL32.dll
	sigil/glew/lib/mingw32/glew32.dll   ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/glew32.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll    ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/libsigil.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll.a  ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/lib/libsigil.dll.a

And you're done! Example projects for every supported compiler are provided in the "examples" folder.
